# hybrid-event-guide

_A collection of resources to help event organisers run hybrid events which blend in-person and online interaction._

This project started at the Collaborations Workshop Hackday in April 2020.

## Are you... 
 
- organising a new hybrid event which combines online and in-person elements: a conference/unconference, hackathon, seminar, tutorial, workshop?
- an experienced organiser, and are hoping to share your knowledge/experience?
- a participant, and would like to pass on advice to the organisers of events you attend?
